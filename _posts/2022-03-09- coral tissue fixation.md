•	10ml FSW (0.2 microns filtered seawater) in a six-well plate. 
•	Cut the sample into approximately 2 cm fragments and place them in the wells.
•	Gently add 2ml of 1M mgcl2 to a single well, and cover the plate with foil for 10 min. *This step is done to prevent the contraction of the tentacles*
•	Remove FSW from the tube, leave 1/2 of the liquid.
•	Add formaldehyde (16% stock solution) to a final concentration of 4% in the well.
